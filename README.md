# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
This project involved conducting an in-depth analysis of movie data from IMDB to uncover patterns that influence the success of movies across various genres, languages, and directors. The analysis examined movie duration, budget, and profitability, providing insights on how these factors impact IMDB ratings. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were used to analyze movie genres and ratings. Additionally, we explored correlations between budget and gross earnings to understand which movies had the highest profit margins. A key aspect of the project was using Excel functions for exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations to present findings clearly. This project not only revealed the influence of genres on ratings but also highlighted the directors and production characteristics that lead to high-performing films.
